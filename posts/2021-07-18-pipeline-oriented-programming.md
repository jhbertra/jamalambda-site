title: Functional Programming - It's All About Pipelines

Being a practitioner of functional programming can be a challenge at times.
While the paradigm offers great benefits such as simplicity, modularity
and safety, it also incurs costs that are rarely talked about. These costs have
little to do with the paradigm its self, and more to do with the context in
which it is often practiced. The majority of software developers don't have more
than a passing familiarity with it, nor do they have a clear idea of how to use
it in practice.

As with any truly difficult problem in software engineering, this is a people
problem, not a technical one. We have done an historically poor job of
explaining functional programming to those not already familiar with it. We tend
to focus on selling people on vague benefits in the hopes that their curiosity
and faith in our expertise will be enough to persuade them to make potentially
costly business decisions. Our own fascination (dare I say obsession?) of
abstractions doesn't help matters. We describe programs in terms of functors,
monads, monoids, semi-lattices, and other such abstract concepts, and in so
doing, we achieve our secret, selfish goal: that others see us as authorities on
the subject.

This perception has a devastating effect on the perception of functional
programming as a whole. The reputation of functional programming is that it is
difficult to learn and requires a trained, mathematical mindset to practice.
