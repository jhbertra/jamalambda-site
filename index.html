<h2>Jamie Bertram's software blog</h2>

<p>
  Hi, I'm Jamie Bertram. I'm also known as jamalambda, because coming up with
  unique and original names is hard, and I'm not super creative. I write
  software and occasionally I write <em>about</em> software too. Here is where
  you will find my trove of such ramblings on the topic. The blog is pretty new,
  so at this point, pretty much any topic is fair game!
</p>

<p>
  Here are some topics you can expect to see discussed:
  <ul>
      <li>Functional programming</li>
      <li>Haskell</li>
      <li>Library design</li>
      <li>Domain modelling</li>
      <li>Software architecture</li>
      <li>New and interesting programming languages</li>
      <li>TypeScript</li>
      <li>Projects I'm working on, or would like to work on</li>
      <li>Philosophy and software</li>
  </ul>
</p>
