<h2>Welcome to my blog!</h2>

<img src="/images/haskell-logo.png" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" />

<p>Here is where I publish my musings on writing software. I discuss projects I am working on, or would like to work on,
programming languages and paradigms, and the lessons I have learned in my career and personal life.</p>

<p>In particular, I write a lot about functional programming in Haskell and TypeScript.</p>
