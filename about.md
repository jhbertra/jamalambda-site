Hi! I'm a software developer living in Ottawa, ON. I like taking a
balanced approach to solving problems, and I believe in the value of
diverse ideas and regularly challenging existing beliefs and wisdom.

I care about developing software engineering practices that promote a
high of standard quality, reliability, accessibility, pragmatism, and
maintainability. In my opinion, the way software engineering is currently
practiced inadequately pursues these qualities. Software engineering is
still a nascent profession, after all. We have a long way to grow before
we really have the right to call ourselves an "engineering" discipline.

I believe the key to this growth to continuously learn and reflect on
what we know, believe, and do. Based on this, I believe we need to get
better at communicating and collaborating with each other, our clients,
and our business partners. We need to stop putting ourselves above others
while simultaneously belittling ourselves by believing that people who
know nothing about what we do are more qualified to make decisions
about how we do our jobs than we are. We need the empathy and humility
to know our weaknesses, and to cherish and defend the people in our
organizations who make up for what we lack. We similarly need the
courage and the self-respect to be resolute in our commitment to not
cut corners, and to stand our ground against the pressure we face
each day to abandon such professional integrity. In short, we need to
start acting like the professionals we are supposed to be. We owe it
to ourselves, our colleagues, our clients, our bosses, the public we
serve, and to society for putting us in the position of privilege we
enjoy.

While I believe that a balanced and multifaceted approach to everything
always yields the best results, I am not afraid to tip the scales and
upset the status quo if I feel there is a better path forward. I
currently see pure functional programming as that better path forward.
While awareness and interest regarding it have steadily been growing in
the last decade, there is still so much more room for it to grow. It
is still widely misunderstood and underappreciated, which is a terrible
shame because there is so much we stand to gain by taking it seriously
and learning the lessons it has to teach. A shared understanding of
theory and mathematical modelling is the foundation of practice in every
other engineering profession that makes them as reliable and effective
as they are. Functional programming can provide this for us. I do not
believe that functional programming is the solution to all our problems.
I do believe however that an understanding of it is _absolutely necessary_
in order to really understand and reason about what we are doing when
we write software, and that we do ourselves and everyone who relies on
us a disservice by neglecting it in our academic institutions, our
professional development, and in the tools and languages we use.

To this end, I have made it my professional mission to relentlessly
pursue knowledge and experience in functional programming - specifically
pure, statically typed functional programming - and to share the lessons,
insights, opportunities, and ideas it has to offer as far and wide as I
can, for the benefit of all. This blog is one such manifestation of this
objective.

Outside of my professional life, my passions are music, nature and animals
(especially birds), gardening, walking, cooking, enjoying the company of
others, and playing chess. I am also a staunch supporter of the humanities,
and their preservation in post-secondary institutions, and have particular
interest in philosophy, linguistics, democracy, politics, and social justice.
